Kids Learning App:
The app I created is meant to help young kids learn the sounds different animals make. 
I created a home screen which is the main activity and main class.
From that class I created an intent that  displays the button that takes you to another activity where the sounds are created in the animalS class. 
With those two I implemented the two class requirement and the multiple activities and intents .
In the other screen when the animal is clicked the sound associated with that animal will play for a few seconds, which implements audio.
I implemented animation by animating the Animal Sounds button and the Home button. I used drawables in both activities in the background and buttons.
I also createD a user interface with layout design and the use of widgets. 
The buttons all implement touch gesture input.
